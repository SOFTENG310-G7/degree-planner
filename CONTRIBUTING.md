## Filing Bug Reports

For any bugs identified from the website, we encourage you to file a bug report by conforming to the following steps.

> Issues > New Issue > Bug report ‘Get Started’

## Suggest New Features

For any new features you would like to see on the website, we encourage you to suggest a new feature by conforming to the following steps.

## Pull Request Submissions

To create a new pull request after having made changes to the code in your fork, select the main branch of the main repository as the destination and link the relevant issues into the description of the pull request. After ensuring the proposed changes pass the tests performed by SonarCloud and all the necessary testing has been performed, the author waits for a reviewer to review their code.

A reviewer will then have to test the changes proposed by the pull request and request for any modifications required before giving their approval. The author or someone with authorization can then squash and merge the pull request into the main branch of the main repository.
