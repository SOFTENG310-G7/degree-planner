# Degree Planner

This project is a website for potential or current University of Auckland students to view the list of courses available at the university and plan their degree or trial other potential degrees to their interest. The website provides additional functionality for users such as the ability to save and share degree plans as well as rating courses based on past experiences. Other future features include incorporating university entrance requirements and plans for recommended courses to aspire for a specific occupation.

## Project Purpose

This website will assist potential tertiary education students in selecting their future degree at the University of Auckland and also help current students in assuring they will not deviate from their desired path until graduation. Our website will achieve these criterias by providing a user-friendly and easily accessible interface for users to navigate through efficiently and allow users the ability to achieve maximum progress with minimal actions.

> Issues > New Issue > Bug report ‘Get Started’

## Suggest New Features

For any new features you would like to see on the website, we encourage you to suggest a new feature by conforming to the following steps.

> Issues > New Issue > Feature request ‘Get Started’

## Pull Request Submissions

To create a new pull request after having made changes to the code in your fork, select the main branch of the main repository as the destination and link the relevant issues into the description of the pull request. After ensuring the proposed changes pass the tests performed by SonarCloud and all the necessary testing has been performed, the author waits for a reviewer to review their code.

A reviewer will then have to test the changes proposed by the pull request and request for any modifications required before giving their approval. The author or someone with authorization can then squash and merge the pull request into the main branch of the main repository.

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, colour, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

**Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:**

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologising to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement to mseo477@aucklanduni.ac.nz via email. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behaviour deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behaviour was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behaviour. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behaviour.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behaviour, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
