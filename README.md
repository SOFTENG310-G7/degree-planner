# Degree Planner

This project is a website for potential or current University of Auckland students to view the list of courses available at the university and plan their degree or trial other potential degrees to their interest. The website provides additional functionality for users such as the ability to save and share degree plans as well as rating courses based on past experiences. Other future features include incorporating university entrance requirements and plans for recommended courses to aspire for a specific occupation.

## Project Purpose

This website will assist potential tertiary education students in selecting their future degree at the University of Auckland and also help current students in assuring they will not deviate from their desired path until graduation. Our website will achieve these criterias by providing a user-friendly and easily accessible interface for users to navigate through efficiently and allow users the ability to achieve maximum progress with minimal actions.
