# Degree Planner

A website for potential or current University of Auckland students to view the list of courses available at the university and plan their degree or trial other potential degrees to their interest.

Degree Planner will assist potential tertiary education students in selecting their future degree at the University of Auckland and also help current students in assuring they will not deviate from their desired path until graduation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Degree Planner is in alpha.**\
> Degree Planner is not feature complete, and not yet ready for widespread adoption. However, it is important to the contributing community that we develop openly and transparently. If you‚Äôre interested in helping us build Degree Planner, we do recommend you use it. Then, check out the [open issues](https://github.com/SOFTENG310-G7/degree-planner/issues), and perhaps [open a new one](https://github.com/SOFTENG310-G7/degree-planner/issues/new/choose) if you see fit!

Planned features include:

- save and share degree plans as well as rating courses based on past experiences;
- incorporate university entrance requirements; and
- recommended course plans tailored for specific occupations.

## üçî Technology stack

Degree Planner is a React-based web app build with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), backed by a [Supabase](https://supabase.com) data store.

> [!NOTE]
> Degree Planner is tested with the latest **long-term support** version of  Node.js, version&nbsp;18. Though it is likely to work with newer releases, they are not officially supported.
